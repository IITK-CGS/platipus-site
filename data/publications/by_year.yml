    abstract: This paper presents results from in silico experiments trying to uncover
      the mechanisms by which people both succeed and fail to reach consensus in networked
      games. We find that the primary cause for failure in such games is preferential
      selection of information sources. Agents forced to sample information from randomly
      selected fixed neighborhoods eventually converge to a consensus, while agents
      free to form their own neighborhoods and forming them on the basis of homophily
      frequently end up creating balkanized cliques. We also find that small-world
      structure mitigates the drive towards consensus in fixed networks, but not for
      self-selecting networks. Preferentially attached networks appear to show the
      highest convergence to one color, thereby showing resilience to balkanization
      of opinion in self-selecting networks. We conclude with a brief discussion of
      the implications of our findings for the representation of behavior in socio-cultural
      modeling.

    abstract: The dissociation between statistical prediction and scientific explanation
      advanced by Bowers et al. for studies of vision using deep neural networks is
      also observed in several other domains of behavior research, and is in fact
      unavoidable when fitting large models such as deep nets and other supervised
      learners, with weak theoretical commitments, to restricted samples of highly
      stochastic behavioral phenomena.

    abstract: The empirical measurement of mental effort is an important problem in
      the cognitive sciences. Recently, researchers have adopted econometric tools
      to attempt to characterize mental effort in terms of monetary costs foregone.
      Such efforts yield a very helpful calculation device - a money utility of mental
      effort. However, since the opportunity cost of applying mental effort in any
      given situation is measured with respect to time rather than money in most ecologically
      reasonable settings, it is even more desirable to obtain a measure of the time
      utility of mental effort. In the absence of direct measurements of mental effort,
      such a task has proved econometrically challenging. We use a recently developed
      direct measure of mental effort to characterize its time utility, finding that
      it is approximately linear in effort. We discuss some implications of this result
      for current theories of mental effort, as well as for practical applications.

    abstract: Recent research has identified intertemporal impulsivity as a critical
      cognitive variable for explaining the autocatalytic nature of socioeconomic
      status. However, how exactly this relationship transpires has yet to be clearly
      identified, with several possible cognitive mechanisms proposed in the literature.
      We designed an experimental paradigm where participants farmed crops under budgetary
      constraints and intermittently faced random resource demands. We discovered
      that, as a result of unpredictable resource shocks, people's preferences shifted
      from long-term choices to short-term ones. We also found people's self-reported
      sense-of-control scores to be predictive of the magnitude of their preference
      shifts. On the basis of these results, we argue that steep inter-temporal discounting
      arises as a rational adaptation to persistently experiencing long-term planning
      failures due to unpredictable resource shocks.

    abstract: Many real-life decisions, such as booking a vacation or selecting a
      partner, involve relatively cost-free sampling of options up to a terminal decision
      point, beyond which the choice becomes costly to reverse. Such problems can
      be formulated as optimal stopping problems (OSPs), such as the famous secretary
      problem. Although human behavior on optimal stopping problems has been studied
      extensively, much of the literature has focused on the behavior of individual
      decision-makers operating using a binary payoff function. In this study, we
      use an OSP with a continuous payoff function to study how individuals’ decisions
      differ from the collective decision of groups of three members working together.
      An independent threshold model offered the best explanation for the behavior
      of both individuals and groups. We found groups performed significantly better
      than individuals, with individuals consistently waiting too long to make a choice
      relative to the optimal strategy. Groups are also more decisive in following
      their internal thresholds, which are also different than a simple average of
      member thresholds. Finally, we also found a lack of long-term learning in OSPs
      for groups, a trend previously documented in individuals.

    abstract: Computational models of perceptual decision-making depend heavily on
      empirical goodness-of-fit measures for model selection. However, it is not possible
      to improve models' fit to data indefinitely, particularly when the data in question
      are variable across multiple elicitations. The completeness of a model or a
      theory assesses the extent to which it can predict observations in comparison
      with an ideal model. We measure the completeness of contemporary race models
      on a paradigmatic perceptual decision-making task - random dot motion discrimination
      - and show that the simple drift diffusion model is already close to complete
      in describing random dot motion discrimination data, with more complex models
      being in fact over-fit to datasets. Thus, in this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate
      limits to the ability of conventional choice fraction and response time data
      to disambiguate complex models of perceptual decision-making.

    abstract: Moral decision-making research is currently dominated by experimental
      studies that employ dilemmas, situations where more than one course of action
      may be justifiable. Humans almost characteristically vacillate between options
      before reaching a conclusion while reasoning on such problems. Current experimental
      designs disregard this vital aspect of moral decisions by only measuring judgments
      produced at the end of reasoning. We present an experimental paradigm for measuring
      moral conflict as a function of vacillations experienced by participants while
      deliberating. We conducted two experiments to correlate our measure with two
      different definitions of conflict prevalent in the literature. Across both experiments,
      we found that people vacillate more on conflicting problems and that vacillations
      correlate with their subjective feeling of conflict and confidence. We also
      found that the pattern of deliberation uncovered by these vacillations is inconsistent
      with currently favored models of moral reasoning and more consistent with a
      single accumulation to threshold process.

    abstract: Computational models of multiple object tracking (MOT) presuppose the
      existence of non-conceptual indexes in visual perception, and as a result predict
      that ID (identification) performance on MOT tasks should be no worse than tracking
      performance for the same stimuli. However, empirical evidence suggests that
      ID performance is worse than tracking performance in MOT. We propose a computational
      model of MOT that is able to account for several empirical results related to
      tracking performance without the use of indexes and thus avoids yoking tracking
      performance to ID performance. We also test our model empirically, contrasting
      it with an existing index-based model, and show that an assumption that avoids
      indexes and instead incorporates an explicit (rather than an implicit) mechanism
      for identity maintenance accounts well for the variation in ID performance with
      increasing number of targets in MOT with visually identical objects.

    abstract: 'Research in decision-making has recently begun to emphasize predictive
      accuracy as the dominant principle for designing and evaluating choice models.
      This emphasis has led to the development of increasingly more precise models
      of humans’ risk preferences, as measured in certain experimental paradigms built
      upon certainty equivalence testing. In this paper, we argue that the level of
      precision attained by recent choice models is illusory, because human preferences
      are irreducibly noisy, so that overly precise predictions are unlikely to reflect
      reality. We support this argument by measuring intra-observer consistency in
      choice behavior in two common risk preference paradigms: decisions from description
      and experience. We find that while current choice models of decisions from experience
      align fairly well with the level of choice consistency seen in our experimental
      data, choice models for decisions from description are significantly more consistent
      with humans’ choices than humans themselves are consistent with their own choices.
      We also found that models of decisions from description generalize poorly across
      sessions of choice responses from the same participants, whereas models of decisions
      from experience generalize quite well. A historical model comparison of 16 influential
      risky choice models on our dataset reveals that it is very difficult to improve
      upon simple expected utility models in predictive ability for aggregate measures
      of risky choices from description. We discuss some theoretical and practical
      implications of our results.'

    abstract: Contemporary models of subjective probability distortions assume that
      distortions arise during probability encoding. However, such assumptions are
      inconsistent with the ability of humans to retrieve probabilities veridically
      in some elicitation formats. We present a sampling-based model of probability
      judgment for risky prospects that assumes that probability distortions occur
      because people read out probability judgments as biased averages from working
      memory contents. Simulations demonstrate that this model shows the classic inverse-S
      shaped distortion of probability judgments using only retrieval-stage assumptions.
      The model further predicts that observers with greater working memory capacity
      would show larger probability distortions on average, which should lead to a
      particular fourfold pattern of risk preference as a function of working memory
      capacity. Using cognitive ability measurements as a proxy for working memory
      capacity, we conducted an experiment with human participants and found results
      consistent with the model's predictions as well as previous empirical studies.
      Our results support a role for sampling during assessment of risky prospects,
      which in turn explains differences in probability distortions seen across different
      elicitation methods.

    abstract: It is intuitive to believe that humans take considerations of mental
      effort into account when making decisions. However, it has proved difficult
      to differentiate theories of mental effort in the absence of direct measurements
      of this psychological construct. Existing measurements of mental effort using
      response times and revealed preferences have low reliability. In this paper,
      we present a new experimental task - selecting between visuomotor lotteries
      using eye-tracking for sampling lotteries - that enables direct measurement
      of mental effort. Unlike response time-based measures, effort measurements in
      this task are not confounded by actual effort allocation. Unlike revealed preference-based
      measures, effort measurements in this task are acquired on a natural scale unitized
      by automatic visual selection processes. We also report results from a simple
      experiment conducted using this task, which reproduce existing findings of costly
      effort-aversion, and also demonstrate adaptive adjustment of mental effort.

    abstract: 'Supervised learning operates on the premise that labels unambiguously
      represent ground truth. This premise is reasonable in domains wherein a high
      degree of consensus is easily possible for any given data record, eg in agreeing
      on whether an image contains an elephant or not. However, there are several
      domains wherein people disagree with each other on the appropriate label to
      assign to a record, eg whether a tweet is toxic. We argue that data labeling
      must be understood as a process with some degree of domain-dependent noise and
      that any claims of predictive prowess must be sensitive to the degree of this
      noise. We present a method for quantifying labeling noise in a particular domain
      wherein people are seen to disagree with their own past selves on the appropriate
      label to assign to a record: choices under prospect uncertainty. Our results
      indicate that ‘state-of-the-art’choice models of decisions from description,
      by failing to consider the intrinsic variability of human choice behavior, find
      themselves in the odd position of predicting humans’ choices better than the
      same humans’ own previous choices for the same problem. We conclude with observations
      on how the predicament we empirically demonstrate in our work could be handled
      in the practice of supervised learning.'
