    abstract: Many real-life decisions, such as booking a vacation or selecting a
      partner, involve relatively cost-free sampling of options up to a terminal decision
      point, beyond which the choice becomes costly to reverse. Such problems can
      be formulated as optimal stopping problems (OSPs), such as the famous secretary
      problem. Although human behavior on optimal stopping problems has been studied
      extensively, much of the literature has focused on the behavior of individual
      decision-makers operating using a binary payoff function. In this study, we
      use an OSP with a continuous payoff function to study how individualsâ€™ decisions
      differ from the collective decision of groups of three members working together.
      An independent threshold model offered the best explanation for the behavior
      of both individuals and groups. We found groups performed significantly better
      than individuals, with individuals consistently waiting too long to make a choice
      relative to the optimal strategy. Groups are also more decisive in following
      their internal thresholds, which are also different than a simple average of
      member thresholds. Finally, we also found a lack of long-term learning in OSPs
      for groups, a trend previously documented in individuals.

    abstract: The empirical measurement of mental effort is an important problem in
      the cognitive sciences. Recently, researchers have adopted econometric tools
      to attempt to characterize mental effort in terms of monetary costs foregone.
      Such efforts yield a very helpful calculation device - a money utility of mental
      effort. However, since the opportunity cost of applying mental effort in any
      given situation is measured with respect to time rather than money in most ecologically
      reasonable settings, it is even more desirable to obtain a measure of the time
      utility of mental effort. In the absence of direct measurements of mental effort,
      such a task has proved econometrically challenging. We use a recently developed
      direct measure of mental effort to characterize its time utility, finding that
      it is approximately linear in effort. We discuss some implications of this result
      for current theories of mental effort, as well as for practical applications.

    abstract: Computational models of multiple object tracking (MOT) presuppose the
      existence of non-conceptual indexes in visual perception, and as a result predict
      that ID (identification) performance on MOT tasks should be no worse than tracking
      performance for the same stimuli. However, empirical evidence suggests that
      ID performance is worse than tracking performance in MOT. We propose a computational
      model of MOT that is able to account for several empirical results related to
      tracking performance without the use of indexes and thus avoids yoking tracking
      performance to ID performance. We also test our model empirically, contrasting
      it with an existing index-based model, and show that an assumption that avoids
      indexes and instead incorporates an explicit (rather than an implicit) mechanism
      for identity maintenance accounts well for the variation in ID performance with
      increasing number of targets in MOT with visually identical objects.

    abstract: It is intuitive to believe that humans take considerations of mental
      effort into account when making decisions. However, it has proved difficult
      to differentiate theories of mental effort in the absence of direct measurements
      of this psychological construct. Existing measurements of mental effort using
      response times and revealed preferences have low reliability. In this paper,
      we present a new experimental task - selecting between visuomotor lotteries
      using eye-tracking for sampling lotteries - that enables direct measurement
      of mental effort. Unlike response time-based measures, effort measurements in
      this task are not confounded by actual effort allocation. Unlike revealed preference-based
      measures, effort measurements in this task are acquired on a natural scale unitized
      by automatic visual selection processes. We also report results from a simple
      experiment conducted using this task, which reproduce existing findings of costly
      effort-aversion, and also demonstrate adaptive adjustment of mental effort.
