  summary:
    I am interested in studying anxiety and decision-making, particularly how the stochastic nature of self-identification impacts an individual's anxiety levels in various environmental stimuli. <br/>
    When I'm not in the lab, you can find me around the campus hunting flowers or stalking cats. And even though I have lots of hobbies, 
    I usually end up enjoying a good nap or naming my plushies—because, let's be real, I'm literally just a girl.

  summary: I seek to understand the dynamics and content of consciousness, what determines when something enters awareness, the mechanisms underlying it, the nature of the associated subjectivity, and the extent to which we have control versus how much unfolds autonomously. I am also interested in trait-based and contextual modulators of these dynamics, as well as their applications to goal-directed behavior and self-regulation.
