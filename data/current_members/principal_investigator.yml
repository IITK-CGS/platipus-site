  summary: In the story of the stone soup, a soldier convinces a village to come together and make soup out of ingredients that they were all individually hoarding in their houses, while going hungry, by the expedient of placing an allegedly magical stone in a pot of water. I think of my role in a similar light; I serve as an excuse for young people to ask interesting questions and learn about the nature of behavior.
