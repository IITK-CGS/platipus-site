  summary: I was interested in figuring out the mysteries of our galaxy when I was young and took up Physics as my undergraduate degree. It turns out human beings are much more mysterious. Serendipitously, I am here studying human behavior. My thesis lies in the confluence of psychology and economics, where I study the structural and psychological factors influencing people's inclination to forego later rewards and choose 'now' using innovative gaming experimental paradigms and computational models.

  summary: Hi, Hari here. I think about quitting. My work focuses on defining the principles behind when people decide to quit an activity. I use behavioral field experiments and large-scale datasets to describe this phenomena. Besides my academic shenanigans, I also run and play video games. Lastly, this bio does not encompass my current lived experiences as a PhD student, which briefly can be described as transient and ever-growing.

  summary: For my Ph.D., I am working on human decision-making, particularly formation, mental representation, reversals of preferences, and the role of attention in the phenomena in domains including and beyond consumer choice. I use behavioural experiments and Bayesian modelling approaches to decipher the cognitive mechanisms involved in decision-making. I spend my leisure time reading Indian philosophies.

  summary: After drifting across many areas of the mind, I have settled on asking questions about the nature of intelligence and its measurement, and hopefully answering them, for my PhD. Apart from that, I ponder about the nature of desire and its dynamics over one's life span, and the behavioral patterns of rule-following and rule-breaking, and their underlying psychological and experiential aspects.
