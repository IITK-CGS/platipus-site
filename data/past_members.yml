  # summary: When tackling tough choices, we often feel pulled in different directions. My broader goal is to characterize this feeling of conflict within such sticky situations. So far for my PhD thesis, my focus has been on developing easier experimental tools to track the process of reasoning to pick out any reliable indicators of conflict. I intend to expand my research into different reasoning contexts to better understand conflict in reasoning.
