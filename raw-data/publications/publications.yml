  abstract: Multiple object tracking (MOT) involves simultaneous tracking of a certain
    number of target objects amongst a larger set of objects as they all move unpredictably
    over time. The prevalent explanation for successful target tracking by humans
    in MOT involving visually identical objects is based on the Visual Indexing Theory.
    This assumes that each target is indexed by a pointer using a non-conceptual mechanism
    to maintain an object’s identity even as its properties change over time. Thus,
    successful tracking requires successful indexing and the absence of identification
    errors. Identity maintenance and successful tracking are measured in terms of
    identification (ID) and tracking accuracy respectively, with higher accuracy indicating
    better identity maintenance or better tracking. Existing evidence suggests that
    humans have high tracking accuracy despite poor identification accuracy, suggesting
    that it might be possible to perform MOT without indexing. Our work adds to existing
    evidence for this position through two experiments, and presents a computational
    model of multiple object tracking that does not require indexes. Our empirical
    results show that identification accuracy is aligned with tracking accuracy in
    humans for tracking up to three, but is lower when tracking more objects. Our
    computational model of MOT without indexing accounts for several empirical tracking
    accuracy patterns shown in earlier studies, reproduces the dissociation between
    tracking and identification accuracy produced earlier in the literature as well
    as in our experiments, and makes several novel predictions.

  abstract: Good posture and form are essential for safe and productive exercising.
    Even in gym settings, trainers may not be readily available for feedback. Rehabilitation
    therapies and fitness workouts can thus benefit from recommender systems that
    provide real-time evaluation. In this paper, we present an algorithmic pipeline
    that can diagnose problems in exercises technique and offer corrective recommendations,
    with high sensitivity and specificity, in real-time. We use MediaPipe for pose
    recognition, count repetitions using peak-prominence detection, and use a learnable
    physics simulator to track motion evolution for each exercise. A test video is
    diagnosed based on deviations from the prototypical learned motion using statistical
    learning. The system is evaluated on six full and upper body exercises. These
    real-time recommendations, counseled via low-cost equipment like smartphones,
    will allow exercisers to rectify potential mistakes making self-practice feasible
    while reducing the risk of workout injuries.

  abstract: This paper presents results from in silico experiments trying to uncover
    the mechanisms by which people both succeed and fail to reach consensus in networked
    games. We find that the primary cause for failure in such games is preferential
    selection of information sources. Agents forced to sample information from randomly
    selected fixed neighborhoods eventually converge to a consensus, while agents
    free to form their own neighborhoods and forming them on the basis of homophily
    frequently end up creating balkanized cliques. We also find that small-world structure
    mitigates the drive towards consensus in fixed networks, but not for self-selecting
    networks. Preferentially attached networks appear to show the highest convergence
    to one color, thereby showing resilience to balkanization of opinion in self-selecting
    networks. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings
    for the representation of behavior in socio-cultural modeling.

  abstract: The empirical measurement of mental effort is an important problem in
    the cognitive sciences. Recently, researchers have adopted econometric tools to
    attempt to characterize mental effort in terms of monetary costs foregone. Such
    efforts yield a very helpful calculation device - a money utility of mental effort.
    However, since the opportunity cost of applying mental effort in any given situation
    is measured with respect to time rather than money in most ecologically reasonable
    settings, it is even more desirable to obtain a measure of the time utility of
    mental effort. In the absence of direct measurements of mental effort, such a
    task has proved econometrically challenging. We use a recently developed direct
    measure of mental effort to characterize its time utility, finding that it is
    approximately linear in effort. We discuss some implications of this result for
    current theories of mental effort, as well as for practical applications.

  abstract: Recent research has identified intertemporal impulsivity as a critical
    cognitive variable for explaining the autocatalytic nature of socioeconomic status.
    However, how exactly this relationship transpires has yet to be clearly identified,
    with several possible cognitive mechanisms proposed in the literature. We designed
    an experimental paradigm where participants farmed crops under budgetary constraints
    and intermittently faced random resource demands. We discovered that, as a result
    of unpredictable resource shocks, people's preferences shifted from long-term
    choices to short-term ones. We also found people's self-reported sense-of-control
    scores to be predictive of the magnitude of their preference shifts. On the basis
    of these results, we argue that steep inter-temporal discounting arises as a rational
    adaptation to persistently experiencing long-term planning failures due to unpredictable
    resource shocks.

  abstract: Many real-life decisions, such as booking a vacation or selecting a partner,
    involve relatively cost-free sampling of options up to a terminal decision point,
    beyond which the choice becomes costly to reverse. Such problems can be formulated
    as optimal stopping problems (OSPs), such as the famous secretary problem. Although
    human behavior on optimal stopping problems has been studied extensively, much
    of the literature has focused on the behavior of individual decision-makers operating
    using a binary payoff function. In this study, we use an OSP with a continuous
    payoff function to study how individuals’ decisions differ from the collective
    decision of groups of three members working together. An independent threshold
    model offered the best explanation for the behavior of both individuals and groups.
    We found groups performed significantly better than individuals, with individuals
    consistently waiting too long to make a choice relative to the optimal strategy.
    Groups are also more decisive in following their internal thresholds, which are
    also different than a simple average of member thresholds. Finally, we also found
    a lack of long-term learning in OSPs for groups, a trend previously documented
    in individuals.

  abstract: Computational models of perceptual decision-making depend heavily on empirical
    goodness-of-fit measures for model selection. However, it is not possible to improve
    models' fit to data indefinitely, particularly when the data in question are variable
    across multiple elicitations. The completeness of a model or a theory assesses
    the extent to which it can predict observations in comparison with an ideal model.
    We measure the completeness of contemporary race models on a paradigmatic perceptual
    decision-making task - random dot motion discrimination - and show that the simple
    drift diffusion model is already close to complete in describing random dot motion
    discrimination data, with more complex models being in fact over-fit to datasets.
    Thus, in this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate limits to the ability of conventional
    choice fraction and response time data to disambiguate complex models of perceptual
    decision-making.

  abstract: Moral decision-making research is currently dominated by experimental
    studies that employ dilemmas, situations where more than one course of action
    may be justifiable. Humans almost characteristically vacillate between options
    before reaching a conclusion while reasoning on such problems. Current experimental
    designs disregard this vital aspect of moral decisions by only measuring judgments
    produced at the end of reasoning. We present an experimental paradigm for measuring
    moral conflict as a function of vacillations experienced by participants while
    deliberating. We conducted two experiments to correlate our measure with two different
    definitions of conflict prevalent in the literature. Across both experiments,
    we found that people vacillate more on conflicting problems and that vacillations
    correlate with their subjective feeling of conflict and confidence. We also found
    that the pattern of deliberation uncovered by these vacillations is inconsistent
    with currently favored models of moral reasoning and more consistent with a single
    accumulation to threshold process.

  abstract: Computational models of multiple object tracking (MOT) presuppose the
    existence of non-conceptual indexes in visual perception, and as a result predict
    that ID (identification) performance on MOT tasks should be no worse than tracking
    performance for the same stimuli. However, empirical evidence suggests that ID
    performance is worse than tracking performance in MOT. We propose a computational
    model of MOT that is able to account for several empirical results related to
    tracking performance without the use of indexes and thus avoids yoking tracking
    performance to ID performance. We also test our model empirically, contrasting
    it with an existing index-based model, and show that an assumption that avoids
    indexes and instead incorporates an explicit (rather than an implicit) mechanism
    for identity maintenance accounts well for the variation in ID performance with
    increasing number of targets in MOT with visually identical objects.

  abstract: 'Research in decision-making has recently begun to emphasize predictive
    accuracy as the dominant principle for designing and evaluating choice models.
    This emphasis has led to the development of increasingly more precise models of
    humans'' risk preferences, as measured in certain experimental paradigms built
    upon certainty equivalence testing. In this paper, we argue that the level of
    precision attained by recent choice models is illusory, because human preferences
    are irreducibly noisy, so that overly precise predictions are unlikely to reflect
    reality. We support this argument by measuring intra-observer consistency in choice
    behavior in two common risk preference paradigms: decisions from description and
    experience. We find that while current choice models of decisions from experience
    align fairly well with the level of choice consistency seen in our experimental
    data, choice models for decisions from description are significantly more consistent
    with humans'' choices than humans themselves are consistent with their own choices.
    We also found that models of decisions from description generalize poorly across
    sessions of choice responses from the same participants, whereas models of decisions
    from experience generalize quite well. A historical model comparison of 16 influential
    risky choice models on our dataset reveals that it is very difficult to improve
    upon simple expected utility models in predictive ability for aggregate measures
    of risky choices from description. We discuss some theoretical and practical implications
    of our results.'

  abstract: Contemporary models of subjective probability distortions assume that
    distortions arise during probability encoding. However, such assumptions are inconsistent
    with the ability of humans to retrieve probabilities veridically in some elicitation
    formats. We present a sampling-based model of probability judgment for risky prospects
    that assumes that probability distortions occur because people read out probability
    judgments as biased averages from working memory contents. Simulations demonstrate
    that this model shows the classic inverse-S shaped distortion of probability judgments
    using only retrieval-stage assumptions. The model further predicts that observers
    with greater working memory capacity would show larger probability distortions
    on average, which should lead to a particular fourfold pattern of risk preference
    as a function of working memory capacity. Using cognitive ability measurements
    as a proxy for working memory capacity, we conducted an experiment with human
    participants and found results consistent with the model's predictions as well
    as previous empirical studies. Our results support a role for sampling during
    assessment of risky prospects, which in turn explains differences in probability
    distortions seen across different elicitation methods.

  abstract: It is intuitive to believe that humans take considerations of mental effort
    into account when making decisions. However, it has proved difficult to differentiate
    theories of mental effort in the absence of direct measurements of this psychological
    construct. Existing measurements of mental effort using response times and revealed
    preferences have low reliability. In this paper, we present a new experimental
    task - selecting between visuomotor lotteries using eye-tracking for sampling
    lotteries - that enables direct measurement of mental effort. Unlike response
    time-based measures, effort measurements in this task are not confounded by actual
    effort allocation. Unlike revealed preference-based measures, effort measurements
    in this task are acquired on a natural scale unitized by automatic visual selection
    processes. We also report results from a simple experiment conducted using this
    task, which reproduce existing findings of costly effort-aversion, and also demonstrate
    adaptive adjustment of mental effort.

  abstract: It is currently difficult to test the validity of existing explanations
    for the emergence of context-dependent preference reversals. This is because these
    explanations are generally placed at the level of the process of evidence accumulation,
    and across experimental paradigms, this process is unobservable. In this paper,
    we propose a new experimental paradigm for eliciting preference reversals, wherein
    the process of evidence accumulation is significantly observable. Over a series
    of experiments, we successfully induce preference reversals for arbitrary stimuli
    by showing participants sequences of stimuli comparisons with pre-determined outcomes.
    Our findings partially support the view that context-sensitive assimilation of
    a history of ordinal comparisons is sufficient to explain classic context effects.
