  title={Groups are Better than Individuals at Solving Optimum Stopping Problems},
  author={Laskar, Pritam and Srivastava, Nisheeth},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society},
  volume={45},
  number={45},
  keywords={Decision Making, Social Cognition},
  year={2023},
  abstract={Many real-life decisions, such as booking a vacation or selecting a partner, involve relatively cost-free sampling of options up to a terminal decision point, beyond which the choice becomes costly to reverse. Such problems can be formulated as optimal stopping problems (OSPs), such as the famous secretary problem. Although human behavior on optimal stopping problems has been studied extensively, much of the literature has focused on the behavior of individual decision-makers operating using a binary payoff function. In this study, we use an OSP with a continuous payoff function to study how individuals’ decisions differ from the collective decision of groups of three members working together. An independent threshold model offered the best explanation for the behavior of both individuals and groups. We found groups performed significantly better than individuals, with individuals consistently waiting too long to make a choice relative to the optimal strategy. Groups are also more decisive in following their internal thresholds, which are also different than a simple average of member thresholds. Finally, we also found a lack of long-term learning in OSPs for groups, a trend previously documented in individuals.}

@inproceedings{srivastava2023measuring,
  title={Measuring the time utility of mental effort},
  author={Mehrotra, Samarth and Srivastava, Nisheeth},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society},
  volume={45},
  number={45},
  keywords={Mental Effort},
  year={2023},
  abstract={The empirical measurement of mental effort is an important problem in the cognitive sciences. Recently, researchers have adopted econometric tools to attempt to characterize mental effort in terms of monetary costs foregone. Such efforts yield a very helpful calculation device - a money utility of mental effort. However, since the opportunity cost of applying mental effort in any given situation is measured with respect to time rather than money in most ecologically reasonable settings, it is even more desirable to obtain a measure of the time utility of mental effort. In the absence of direct measurements of mental effort, such a task has proved econometrically challenging. We use a recently developed direct measure of mental effort to characterize its time utility, finding that it is approximately linear in effort. We discuss some implications of this result for current theories of mental effort, as well as for practical applications.}

@inproceedings{ayare2023tracking,
  title={Tracking Multiple Objects without Indexes},
  author={Ayare, Shubhamkar and Srivastava, Nisheeth},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society},
  volume={45},
  number={45},
  year={2023},
  keywords={Multiple Object Tracking, Visual Indexing Theory},
  url={https://escholarship.org/uc/item/29x6398w},
  abstract={Computational models of multiple object tracking (MOT) presuppose the existence of non-conceptual indexes in visual perception, and as a result predict that ID (identification) performance on MOT tasks should be no worse than tracking performance for the same stimuli. However, empirical evidence suggests that ID performance is worse than tracking performance in MOT. We propose a computational model of MOT that is able to account for several empirical results related to tracking performance without the use of indexes and thus avoids yoking tracking performance to ID performance. We also test our model empirically, contrasting it with an existing index-based model, and show that an assumption that avoids indexes and instead incorporates an explicit (rather than an implicit) mechanism for identity maintenance accounts well for the variation in ID performance with increasing number of targets in MOT with visually identical objects.}

@inproceedings{srivastava2022selecting,
  title={Selecting between visuomotor lotteries to measure mental effort in risky decisions},
  author={Mehrotra, Samarth and Srivastava, Nisheeth},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society},
  volume={44},
  number={44},
  year={2022},
  keywords={Decision Making, Mental Effort},
  abstract={It is intuitive to believe that humans take considerations of mental effort into account when making decisions. However, it has proved difficult to differentiate theories of mental effort in the absence of direct measurements of this psychological construct. Existing measurements of mental effort using response times and revealed preferences have low reliability. In this paper, we present a new experimental task - selecting between visuomotor lotteries using eye-tracking for sampling lotteries - that enables direct measurement of mental effort. Unlike response time-based measures, effort measurements in this task are not confounded by actual effort allocation. Unlike revealed preference-based measures, effort measurements in this task are acquired on a natural scale unitized by automatic visual selection processes. We also report results from a simple experiment conducted using this task, which reproduce existing findings of costly effort-aversion, and also demonstrate adaptive adjustment of mental effort.}
