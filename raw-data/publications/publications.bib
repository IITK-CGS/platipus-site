However, how exactly this interaction transpires is yet to be identified. We hypothesize that impulsivity arises from planning failures due to unpredictable resource demands, and people learn to adapt to this by being present-focused. We tested this hypothesis across three studies using a novel paradigm in which participants used a farming simulator and chose crops with different risk and time preferences. We found that participants' revealed time preferences adaptively shortened when they faced resource shocks and expanded in the absence of such shocks. We also found greater shrinkage of temporal horizons when these shocks were unpredictable rather than predictable. Our work shows that irrationality need not be invoked to explain the occurrence of present-bias in low SES individuals, and that such behavior may simply be a rational adaptation to the environmental demands of planning under precarity.}",

  abstract={A widely studied cognitive bias in decision-making is the ‘attraction effect’ or ‘asymmetric dominance effect’, where introducing a clearly inferior decoy option to a binary choice set increases the likelihood of choosing the dominating option (target) over the other (competitor). While there is a consensus in the literature that the attraction effect is robust with numerical stimuli, there have been inconsistent results with perceptual stimuli (Frederick et al., 2014). This numerical-perceptual distinction was further supported in some recent studies involving perceptual stimuli claiming to have produced a negative attraction effect (Spektor et al., 2018, 2022). We argue that this distinction does not exist and that people’s choice behavior is better explained by inter-attribute relationships. In this study, we conducted two experiments where we showed positive attraction effects with combined perceptual-numerical stimuli (having both perceptual and numerical attributes) and both positive and null effects with numerical stimuli by manipulating the asymmetry in pair-wise comparison difficulty. In Experiment 1, we provided evidence for a strong attraction effect for perceptual-numerical stimuli by ensuring the tradeoff between the attributes are difficult. Next, in Experiment 2, we manipulated the competitor-decoy (CD) comparison difficulty while controlling for a confound—target-competitor (TC) comparison difficulty, a factor that has yet to be addressed by studies that have produced a positive attraction effect with perceptual stimuli. To achieve this manipulation, we leveraged findings from mathematical cognition and education research on fraction comparison, effectively activating or suppressing the standard attraction effect through our experimental design. Taken together, the results from both studies challenge the superficial distinction between stimulus types and support a universal cognitive mechanism underlying the ubiquitous attraction effect.

  abstract={Stopping decisions are frequently modeled as decisions to switch to alternative activities once the current activity stops being adequately rewarding, such as in optimal foraging theory, as well as more recent metacognitive models. However, the sense of stopping and making decisions in such frameworks is highly platonic, with both decisions and stopping actions occurring instantaneously. In contrast, the phenomenology
of quitting actions that one is undertaking appears to be temporally extended and metacognitively challenging. We study the metacognitive covariates of quitting decisions made by chess players using a large database of chess games sourced from an online chess portal. Our analysis reveals that players tend to persevere when they are playing against stronger opponents and after having played poor moves. We also find that a history of quitting games makes players more likely to quit in future games, but that having recently quit in a game offers some protective effect against quitting. Finally, we find that quitting a game makes it more likely that a player will play a game again soon. We place these results in the context of modeling quitting as a metacognitive choice affected by multiple competing goals.}

    abstract = "{Multiple object tracking (MOT) involves simultaneous tracking of a certain number of target objects amongst a larger set of objects as they all move unpredictably over time. The prevalent explanation for successful target tracking by humans in MOT involving visually identical objects is based on the Visual Indexing Theory. This assumes that each target is indexed by a pointer using a non-conceptual mechanism to maintain an object’s identity even as its properties change over time. Thus, successful tracking requires successful indexing and the absence of identification errors. Identity maintenance and successful tracking are measured in terms of identification (ID) and tracking accuracy respectively, with higher accuracy indicating better identity maintenance or better tracking. Existing evidence suggests that humans have high tracking accuracy despite poor identification accuracy, suggesting that it might be possible to perform MOT without indexing. Our work adds to existing evidence for this position through two experiments, and presents a computational model of multiple object tracking that does not require indexes. Our empirical results show that identification accuracy is aligned with tracking accuracy in humans for tracking up to three, but is lower when tracking more objects. Our computational model of MOT without indexing accounts for several empirical tracking accuracy patterns shown in earlier studies, reproduces the dissociation between tracking and identification accuracy produced earlier in the literature as well as in our experiments, and makes several novel predictions.}",

We find that the primary cause for failure in such games is preferential selection of information sources. Agents forced to sample information from randomly selected fixed neighborhoods eventually converge to a consensus, while agents free to form their own neighborhoods and forming them on the basis of homophily frequently end up creating balkanized cliques. We also find that small-world structure mitigates the drive towards consensus in fixed networks, but not for self-selecting networks. Preferentially attached networks appear to show the highest convergence to one color, thereby showing resilience to balkanization of opinion in self-selecting networks. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for the representation of behavior in socio-cultural modeling.}

  abstract={The empirical measurement of mental effort is an important problem in the cognitive sciences. Recently, researchers have adopted econometric tools to attempt to characterize mental effort in terms of monetary costs foregone. Such efforts yield a very helpful calculation device - a money utility of mental effort. However, since the opportunity cost of applying mental effort in any given situation is measured with respect to time rather than money in most ecologically reasonable settings, it is even more desirable to obtain a measure of the time utility of mental effort. In the absence of direct measurements of mental effort, such a task has proved econometrically challenging. We use a recently developed direct measure of mental effort to characterize its time utility, finding that it is approximately linear in effort. We discuss some implications of this result for current theories of mental effort, as well as for practical applications.}

However, how exactly this relationship transpires has yet to be clearly identified, with several possible cognitive mechanisms proposed in the literature. We designed an experimental paradigm where participants farmed crops under budgetary constraints and intermittently faced random resource demands. We discovered that, as a result of unpredictable resource shocks, people's preferences shifted from long-term choices to short-term ones. We also found people's self-reported sense-of-control scores to be predictive of the magnitude of their preference shifts. On the basis of these results, we argue that steep inter-temporal discounting arises as a rational adaptation to persistently experiencing long-term planning failures due to unpredictable resource shocks.}

  abstract={Many real-life decisions, such as booking a vacation or selecting a partner, involve relatively cost-free sampling of options up to a terminal decision point, beyond which the choice becomes costly to reverse. Such problems can be formulated as optimal stopping problems (OSPs), such as the famous secretary problem. Although human behavior on optimal stopping problems has been studied extensively, much of the literature has focused on the behavior of individual decision-makers operating using a binary payoff function. In this study, we use an OSP with a continuous payoff function to study how individuals’ decisions differ from the collective decision of groups of three members working together. An independent threshold model offered the best explanation for the behavior of both individuals and groups. We found groups performed significantly better than individuals, with individuals consistently waiting too long to make a choice relative to the optimal strategy. Groups are also more decisive in following their internal thresholds, which are also different than a simple average of member thresholds. Finally, we also found a lack of long-term learning in OSPs for groups, a trend previously documented in individuals.}

However, it is not possible to improve models' fit to data indefinitely, particularly when the data in question are variable across multiple elicitations. The completeness of a model or a theory assesses the extent to which it can predict observations in comparison with an ideal model. We measure the completeness of contemporary race models on a paradigmatic perceptual decision-making task - random dot motion discrimination - and show that the simple drift diffusion model is already close to complete in describing random dot motion discrimination data, with more complex models being in fact over-fit to datasets. Thus, in this paper, we quantitatively demonstrate limits to the ability of conventional choice fraction and response time data to disambiguate complex models of perceptual decision-making.}

Humans almost characteristically vacillate between options before reaching a conclusion while reasoning on such problems. Current experimental designs disregard this vital aspect of moral decisions by only measuring judgments produced at the end of reasoning. We present an experimental paradigm for measuring moral conflict as a function of vacillations experienced by participants while deliberating. We conducted two experiments to correlate our measure with two different definitions of conflict prevalent in the literature. Across both experiments, we found that people vacillate more on conflicting problems and that vacillations correlate with their subjective feeling of conflict and confidence. We also found that the pattern of deliberation uncovered by these vacillations is inconsistent with currently favored models of moral reasoning and more consistent with a single accumulation to threshold process.}

We propose a computational model of MOT that is able to account for several empirical results related to tracking performance without the use of indexes and thus avoids yoking tracking performance to ID performance. We also test our model empirically, contrasting it with an existing index-based model, and show that an assumption that avoids indexes and instead incorporates an explicit (rather than an implicit) mechanism for identity maintenance accounts well for the variation in ID performance with increasing number of targets in MOT with visually identical objects.}

  abstract={Research in decision-making has recently begun to emphasize predictive accuracy as the dominant principle for designing and evaluating choice models. This emphasis has led to the development of increasingly more precise models of humans' risk preferences, as measured in certain experimental paradigms built upon certainty equivalence testing. In this paper, we argue that the level of precision attained by recent choice models is illusory, because human preferences are irreducibly noisy, so that overly precise predictions are unlikely to reflect reality. We support this argument by measuring intra-observer consistency in choice behavior in two common risk preference paradigms: decisions from description and experience. We find that while current choice models of decisions from experience align fairly well with the level of choice consistency seen in our experimental data, choice models for decisions from description are significantly more consistent with humans' choices than humans themselves are consistent with their own choices. We also found that models of decisions from description generalize poorly across sessions of choice responses from the same participants, whereas models of decisions from experience generalize quite well. A historical model comparison of 16 influential risky choice models on our dataset reveals that it is very difficult to improve upon simple expected utility models in predictive ability for aggregate measures of risky choices from description. We discuss some theoretical and practical implications of our results.}

  abstract={Contemporary models of subjective probability distortions assume that distortions arise during probability encoding. However, such assumptions are inconsistent with the ability of humans to retrieve probabilities veridically in some elicitation formats. We present a sampling-based model of probability judgment for risky prospects that assumes that probability distortions occur because people read out probability judgments as biased averages from working memory contents. Simulations demonstrate that this model shows the classic inverse-S shaped distortion of probability judgments using only retrieval-stage assumptions. The model further predicts that observers with greater working memory capacity would show larger probability distortions on average, which should lead to a particular fourfold pattern of risk preference as a function of working memory capacity. Using cognitive ability measurements as a proxy for working memory capacity, we conducted an experiment with human participants and found results consistent with the model's predictions as well as previous empirical studies. Our results support a role for sampling during assessment of risky prospects, which in turn explains differences in probability distortions seen across different elicitation methods.}

In this paper, we present a new experimental task - selecting between visuomotor lotteries using eye-tracking for sampling lotteries - that enables direct measurement of mental effort. Unlike response time-based measures, effort measurements in this task are not confounded by actual effort allocation. Unlike revealed preference-based measures, effort measurements in this task are acquired on a natural scale unitized by automatic visual selection processes. We also report results from a simple experiment conducted using this task, which reproduce existing findings of costly effort-aversion, and also demonstrate adaptive adjustment of mental effort.}

Our results show that people do learn category-specific information incidentally, and that the pattern of their judgments is broadly consistent with normative Bayesian reasoning at the cohort level, but with large individual-level variability. We find that this variability is explained well by a frugal memory sampling approximation; observer models making this assumption explain approximately 70% of the variation in participants' responses. We also find that behavior while judging easily discriminable categories is consistent with a model observer drawing fewer samples from memory, while behavior while judging less discriminable categories is better fit by models drawing more samples from memory. Thus, our model-based analysis additionally reveals resource-rationality in memory sampling.}

  abstract={Research in decision-making has recently begun to emphasize predictive accuracy as the dominant principle for designing and evaluating choice models. This emphasis has led to the development of increasingly more precise models of humans' risk preferences, as measured in certain experimental paradigms built upon certainty equivalence testing. In this paper, we argue that the level of precision attained by recent choice models is unexpected, because human preferences are irreducibly noisy. We support this argument by conducting experiments to measure intra-observer consistency in choice behavior in two common risk preference paradigms: decisions from description and experience. We find that while current choice models of decisions from experience align fairly well with the upper limits of choice consistency seen in our experimental data, choice models for decisions from description are significantly more consistent with humans' choices than the humans themselves are consistent with their own choices. We discuss some theoretical and practical implications of our results.}

  abstract={It is currently difficult to test the validity of existing explanations for the emergence of context-dependent preference reversals. This is because these explanations are generally placed at the level of the process of evidence accumulation, and across experimental paradigms, this process is unobservable. In this paper, we propose a new experimental paradigm for eliciting preference reversals, wherein the process of evidence accumulation is significantly observable. Over a series of experiments, we successfully induce preference reversals for arbitrary stimuli by showing participants sequences of stimuli comparisons with pre-determined outcomes. Our findings partially support the view that context-sensitive assimilation of a history of ordinal comparisons is sufficient to explain classic context effects.}
