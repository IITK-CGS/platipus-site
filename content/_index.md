Our lab hosts scholars interested in studying behavior across scales with a computational approach. Being embedded in the Department of Cognitive Science at IIT Kanpur, the lab has a bias towards studying behavior that can be broadly construed as cognitive in nature, but our ambit extends to both smaller and larger organized systems that exhibit interesting behavior. The lab name reflects our only consistent philosophy banking on ‘serendipity’ in how we approach our questions and the methods we use to answer them.

To know more about what our platypi do, you can visit the **[People](./people/)** page.
