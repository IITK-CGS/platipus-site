Welcome to the PLATIPUS Lab. We are eclectic cognitive scientists trying to capture phenomenal aspects of the human mind through a computational lens. Our members bring forward an intricate web of ideas derived from our varied academic backgrounds. Our only consistent lab philosophy banks on `serendipity` in how we approach our questions and the methods we use to answer them.

To know more about what our little platypi do, you can visit the [People](./people/) page.

To know more about the past and ongoing work in the lab, please visit the [Publications](./publications/by-year) page.
